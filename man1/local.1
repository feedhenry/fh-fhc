.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command can be used to allow you to locally develop applications, the cloud portion of your app will be run locally\. If you haven\'t run the \fBfhc initlocal\fR command first, it will be automatically done\. \fBfhc initlocal\fR requires access to the Internet, to download some settings, scripts, and CSS files from our cloud platform\.
.
.P
This command must be run from the root of your app, i\.e\. the folder which contains your cloud, client and shared directories\.
.
.P
Only the \fB<appid>\fR parameter is required\. Just running "fhc local <appid>" will run the cloud code and server the client files locally\.
.
.P
If you are using the $fh\.cache API calls in your cloud code, you should run a locally accessible redis server\.  The redis host, port, and password can be specified on the command line and default to; host: 127\.0\.0\.1, port: 6379, password: ""
.
.P
If you are using the $fh\.db() API calls in your cloud code, you should run a mondoDB server locally\.  The mongo server is expected to be at; host: 127\.0\.0\.1, and port: 27017, (the default mongo configuration)
.
.P
The client and server sides of the app will be running on seperate ports locally, by default they will be 8000 and 8001
