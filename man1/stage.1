.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command can be used to stage your FeedHenry applications, either to the \'development\' or \'live\' FeedHenry environment\. The \'\-\-clean\' flag can be used to do a full clean restage, which has the following effect:
 \- cleans out all old application log files
 \- will remove any cached node npm modules and do an \'npm install\' from scratch\.
.
.P
When deploy to \'live\' environment, the approver\'s name or email should be set\. If it\'s not set in the command line, the user will be prompted for it\. A comment can be added for the stage but it\'s optional\.
